## OVERVIEW

Challenge was not as complex as it seemed, was pretty fun and a few things to learn from it.

## THE CHALLENGE

-I was able to create the layout using flex and i think i did pretty well.
-hover states for the links which was never a problem.
-the real challenge was to be able to toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" which was made easy with the use of "EventListener".

## MY PROCESS

My process was pretty simple, after a little research, i found creating multiple wepages would be easier instead of going heavy on JS. After creating multiple webpages using flexbox and added JS in the HTML file to for the toggle function.

## BUILT WITH

-HTML 5 markup
-CSS custom properties
-Flexbox

## WHAT I LEARNT

My first time using the "const" variable.

i also got to work with this.
overview.addEventListener("click", function(){

As i simple as this may sound, i just learnt about relative paths.

## CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

My plan is to continue developing by building more projects, Intermediate ones for now.

## USEFUL RESOURCES

Google, W3school.
